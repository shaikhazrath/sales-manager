    "text": "Tenali AI\nWhy Tenali ?\nFeatures\nDemo\nContact Us\nSign Up\nB2B Sales\nAI\nLess is More: Amalgamating Yusuf Dikec's Winning Formula for B2B Sales with AI\n\nDiscover how Tenali AI transforms complex B2B sales cycles, slashing costs by 86.3% and boosting efficiency. Free your expert team to focus on high-value, late-stage opportunities and elevate your GTM organization to Olympic-level performance with Tenali AI.\n\nIn the competitive landscape of B2B Enterprise sales, time and expertise are crucial for success. Sales reps often must pull in a range of experts, such as sales engineers, product managers, product specialists, product specialists engineers, competitive experts, and sales managers, just to answer customer questions during calls. In this blog, we analyze the cost and time implications of involving multiple specialists in initial sales calls and prove how Tenali AI can significantly enhance sales team effectiveness, shorten sales cycles and reduce cost-per-call without replacing essential team members.\n\nThe Traditional Approach vs. The Tenali AI Revolution\n\nImagine a sales call where seven or more company representatives face off against a single customer. This common practice in B2B sales isn't just overwhelming‚Äîit erodes profitability! While thorough, this approach of pulling in various experts for every query bloats the sales cycle and drains resources. Every expert involved means time away from more critical, late-stage deals where their input is crucial. The result? Skyrocketing costs and a sluggish sales process that ultimately hurts the bottom line.\n\nNow, picture a sales rep armed with Tenali AI. They stand alone but carry the knowledge of an entire team at their fingertips. This stark contrast is beautifully illustrated in the image above of Yusuf Dikec from Olympics 2024, comparing a complex team setup to a single, empowered seller.\n\nBreaking Down the Numbers\n\nLet's look at the cold, hard facts. Here's a cost breakdown comparing these two approaches:\n\nLet's assume a sales rep is running a sales call 50% of their time. That is 4 hours per day, 20 hours per week, 80 hours per month. Therefore, Tenali AI cost: $200/month √∑ 80 hours = $2.50/hour.\n\nTenali harnesses cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs), and as the costs of these models decrease, we pass the cost savings directly to our customers. Our commitment to fair business practices and customer obsession remains our top priority.\n\nThe Impact: More Than Just Numbers\n\n1. Dramatic Cost Reduction: An 86.3% decrease in cost per call. That's not just savings; it's a complete change in basic assumptions.\n\n2. Scalability: With Tenali AI, a company can handle 8 times more calls with the same budget. Imagine the potential for market reach and growth.\n\n3. Consistency and Speed: Instant, verified responses from your product and engineering team to ensure that every customer interaction is of the highest quality, leading to quicker responses, faster decision-making, and shorter sales cycles.\n\n4. Resource Optimization: Experts are no longer tied down by routine customer queries, freeing up their time to focus on strategic initiatives and later stages of sales cycles where their expertise truly adds value.\n\n5. ROI Potential: At just $200 per month, Tenali AI pays for itself almost immediately. If it can handle 4 hours of calls per day, over a 20-day work month, this means an equivalent of $34,598.40 saved in expert time. This equates to a 173x return on investment for the cost of Tenali AI. Everything beyond that first call is pure gain.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nThis isn't just about cutting costs. It's about re-imagining what's possible for your sellers and customers. Tenali gives each sales rep a superpower ‚Äì the ability to access and deploy the collective knowledge of an entire organisation instantly. Your customers have been expecting your sales teams to be knowledgeable at least about what they are selling.\n\nThe potential impact is staggering:\n\n$373.25 saved per hour of calls\nPotential monthly savings of $29,860\nAn exponential increase in sales capacity and reach\nDelighted customersüòä¬†\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nIn today's challenging economic climate, where CFOs demand more output with fewer resources, AI-powered sales tools like Tenali AI aren't just advantageous ‚Äì they're essential. These solutions allow teams to dramatically increase productivity without expanding headcount, addressing both performance and financial pressures.\n\nThe future of B2B sales is here, blending AI efficiency with human expertise. Are you ready to take your GTM organisation to Olympic levels of performance?\n\nSources:\nhttps://wellfound.com/hiring-data/l/san-francisco-bay-area/i/saas\nhttps://www.indeed.com/jobs?l=San+Francisco%2C+CA&q=Saas+Sales&from=mobRdr&utm_source=%2Fm%2F\nhttps://www.indeed.com/jobs?l=San+Francisco%2C+CA&q=Saas+Sales&from=mobRdr&utm_source=%2Fm%2F\nhttps://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/product-management/product-manager-salary-san-francisco/\nhttps://userpilot.com/blog/product-specialist-career-path/\nhttps://www.ziprecruiter.in/?utm_source=zr-go-redirect\n\nTenali AI\n\nBlog\n\nLess is More: Amalgamating Yusuf Dikec's Winning Formula for B2B Sales with AI\nIntroducing Tenali Enterprise Search: Private & Secure ChatGPT with your data\nHow to Jolt Your Prospects Out of Indecision with Real Examples\n\nLegal\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nZoom SDK Integration\n\n¬© 2024 by Tenali AI, Inc.

    "text": "Tenali AI\nWhy Tenali ?\nFeatures\nDemo\nContact Us\nSign Up\nChatGPT\nEnterprise Search\nShorten Sales Cycles\nIntroducing Tenali Enterprise Search: Private & Secure ChatGPT with your data\n\nIn today's fast-paced sales environment, time is money. Yet, how much of that precious time do your sales reps spend digging through mountains of information just to answer a single customer question? It's a frustrating reality that many sales professionals face daily. But what if there was a better way? What if all you had to do was \"Ask\"?\n\nAs sales reps, we know that time is your most valuable resource. Time kills deals! Yet, sales reps often waste hours sifting through internal documents, emails, and databases, all in a quest to find one critical piece of information that could make or break a deal.\n\nAt Tenali, we‚Äôve been listening to the challenges of sales teams, and today, we‚Äôre thrilled to introduce Tenali Enterprise Search ‚Äî a simple tool that gives sales reps instant access to verified answers, whether from your company‚Äôs knowledge base like Intercom, Google Drive, OneDrive, or even Learning Management Systems like Seismic, HighSpot, Showpad, plus 100+ other data sources. Truth be told, your company website is also a powerful data source, often overlooked.\n\nWhy Tenali Enterprise Search Is the Simplest Tool Sales Teams Need\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about how Tenali compares to the competition. While tools like Guru, Docket, and Glean have served as knowledge management platforms, Tenali Enterprise Search goes beyond with three key benefits tailored for sales reps:\n\n1. Real-Time Answers, Not Just Knowledge Curation\n\nOther platforms focus heavily on curating and organizing knowledge, often requiring time-consuming manual input from subject matter experts (SMEs) or knowledge teams. This leads to sales reps spending too much time searching and reading through long articles, battle cards, or complex documents.\n\nTenali Enterprise Search changes the game by delivering instant, verified answers to your reps‚Äô questions, directly sourced from the company knowledge base or even from your website. There‚Äôs no need to sift through documents or track down SMEs ‚Äî just ask a question and get the answer. No middleman needed.\n\nExample: A sales rep needs the latest competitive analysis during pre-call prep. With Tenali, they ask, ‚ÄúWhat are our advantages over Competitor X?‚Äù and receive an immediate, concise answer, complete with cited sources. No more digging through Guru collections or waiting for updates. Especially if you're new and don‚Äôt know who to ask.\n\n2. Speed and Simplicity\n\nGuru and Glean provide solid tools, but they often rely on user-generated content and can fall behind in keeping information updated. Docket, while powerful for content management, isn‚Äôt built for the fast-paced world of sales, where answers need to be instant and simple.\n\nWith Tenali, we prioritize speed and ease of use. Answers are concise (typically 2-3 sentences), sourced, and delivered in under 4 seconds, helping sales reps stay focused on building customer relationships, not on hunting for information.\n\nExample: Imagine a new sales rep onboarding at your company. Instead of searching through multiple knowledge sources or combing through endless training videos, Tenali gives them instant access to the most relevant data with a simple query ‚Äî helping them ramp up faster and hit quota sooner.\n\n3. No Internal Database? No Problem\n\nHere‚Äôs where Tenali truly sets itself apart. Unlike Guru or Glean, which rely almost exclusively on internal databases, Tenali can retrieve data directly from your company‚Äôs website. This flexibility makes Tenali the ultimate solution for sales teams that need to balance internal security concerns with real-time access to accurate information. After all, how often are we really sharing proprietary info?\n\nExample: You‚Äôre working on an RFP, and your company‚Äôs knowledge base is outdated. With Tenali, a rep can pull accurate, up-to-date info straight from the website, including product specs, case studies, and customer success stories ‚Äî all without compromising sensitive internal data. Meanwhile, your marketing team stays on its toes, ensuring that public-facing data is always current for customers.\n\nReal-World Use Cases of Tenali Enterprise Search\n\nHow can your sales team benefit from Tenali Enterprise Search? Here are just a few examples:\n\nRFP/RFQ Responses: Reps can quickly pull the most relevant case studies, product specs, and success stories without digging through multiple files.\nPre-call Prep: Before a client meeting, reps can get the latest insights on product updates, competitor comparisons, and key differentiators.\nProposal Building: Need accurate pricing or feature details? Tenali delivers the info immediately, helping your team build strong, competitive proposals faster.\nNew Rep Onboarding: Tenali empowers new hires by giving them easy access to company knowledge without overwhelming them with excess information, shortening the ramp-up period.\nThe Tenali Platform: Beyond Search\n\nTenali isn't just about finding information‚Äîit's about transforming your entire sales process:\n\nLive Call Assistance: Get real-time support during customer calls.\nAutomated Meeting Notes: Focus on the conversation while Tenali captures key points.\nAI-Generated Follow-ups: Send personalized, context-aware emails post-meeting.\n\nBy automating these tasks, Tenali frees up your time to focus on what matters most: building relationships and closing deals.\n\nTry Tenali Enterprise Search Today - it's made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Sales Reps, for Sales Reps\n\nBook a demo or sign up now to see Tenali in action!

I recently read the Jolt Effect by Ted McKenna and Dixon Matthew, a strategy focused on overcoming customer indecision. This blog provides you examples on how to guide prospects who are stuck in a cycle of analysis paralysis toward confident decisions.\n\nSales has changed. The old playbook isn't enough anymore. Here's why:\n\n40-60% of deals are lost to no decision\nCustomers have FOMU‚ÄîFear of Messing Up more than FOMO - Fear of Missing Out\nTraditional techniques often backfire (You know them!)\n\nHere‚Äôs how you can master indecision with actionable examples from The Jolt Effect:\n\n1. When Prospects Say: ‚ÄúWe need more time to evaluate our options.‚Äù\n\nAE Response (Jolt Effect in Action):\n\"That makes sense‚Äîthis is an important decision. However, what I often see is that too many options can lead to analysis paralysis, which keeps teams stuck in decision-making limbo. If it‚Äôs helpful, I can walk you through a simplified comparison between our solution and the alternatives based on your most pressing needs. This way, we can narrow down the choices and eliminate anything that doesn‚Äôt align with your goals. Would that help speed up the process?\"\n\nWhy This Works: Prospects often get overwhelmed when evaluating multiple solutions. By simplifying the decision-making process, you guide them to focus on the solution that aligns best with their objectives. The Jolt Effect calls for reducing complexity to move them forward.\n\n2. When Prospects Say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if this is the right time.‚Äù\n\nAE Response (Jolt Effect in Action):\n\"I completely understand the hesitation‚Äîtiming is always a critical factor in decisions like this. What I‚Äôve found in working with similar companies is that waiting often results in missed opportunities or increased costs in the long run. For example, [Client X] felt the same way but decided to move forward, and they were able to save 15% on operational costs within six months. Let‚Äôs look at the risks of delaying versus the immediate value we can start delivering right now. I‚Äôll guide you through both scenarios so we can make the right choice together.\"\n\nWhy This Works: Prospects often hesitate due to fear of making a bad decision. By reframing the conversation around the risks of inaction, you encourage them to see the value of acting now, a key tactic from The Jolt Effect.\n\n3. When Prospects Say: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to make a decision we‚Äôll regret.‚Äù\n\nAE Response (Jolt Effect in Action):\n\"That‚Äôs completely understandable. What I recommend is a phased approach where we start small, see the results, and then scale up if it‚Äôs a fit. This way, you can feel confident before making a full commitment.\"\n\nWhy This Works: This response reduces the perceived risk for the prospect by offering a low-risk, step-by-step implementation plan. The Jolt Effect teaches that reducing risk can jolt prospects out of their fear of making the wrong choice.\n\n4. When Prospects Say: \"I‚Äôm just not sure if we‚Äôll get internal buy-in for this.\"\n\nAE Response (Jolt Effect in Action ):\n\"That‚Äôs completely understandable‚Äîinternal buy-in is key. I‚Äôve seen teams who‚Äôve initially had the same concern but were able to build strong internal support by focusing on how this solution directly impacts key metrics, like revenue or efficiency. I can help you craft a compelling case for your team that outlines the tangible ROI and addresses potential objections before they come up. Let‚Äôs work together on creating something that ensures everyone feels confident in this decision.\"\n\nWhy This Works: The AE reframes the concern about internal buy-in into an opportunity to partner with the prospect in building a solid business case. By proactively addressing objections and helping with internal alignment, the AE positions themselves as a problem-solver, not just a vendor.\n\n5. When Prospects Say: \"We‚Äôre worried about the implementation process‚Äîit sounds complex.\"\n\nAE Response (Jolt Effect in Action):\n\"I totally get that‚Äîimplementation can feel overwhelming. But one thing we‚Äôve learned is that by simplifying the process and breaking it into smaller steps, we make it much more manageable. With [Client Z], we did a phased rollout, and they were fully up and running within a month with minimal disruption. Plus, we‚Äôll have a dedicated team working with you every step of the way to make sure it‚Äôs seamless. Let‚Äôs outline a simple roadmap for you so you can see how we‚Äôll tackle each stage.\"\n\nWhy This Works: The AE minimizes the fear of a complex implementation by simplifying the process and offering hands-on support. By breaking it into manageable steps, they reduce the mental barriers associated with moving forward.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Embrace the Jolt Effect and Lead with Confidence\n\nRemember, indecision is often a sign of underlying fear or uncertainty, not an insurmountable obstacle. By mastering the Jolt Effect, you can address these fears head-on and turn hesitation into action. Equip yourself with the tools to simplify decisions, highlight the risks of inaction, and offer low-risk trials. Each time you successfully guide a prospect out of indecision, you‚Äôre not just closing a deal‚Äîyou‚Äôre building trust and proving your value as a strategic partner.\n\nAction Item: Go to your CRM, look at deals that haven't moved in 2 weeks. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs their real fear?‚Äù Reach out to the prospect and start applying these techniques in your next conversation and watch how quickly you can turn indecision into commitment.\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://www.jolteffect.com/\n\n2. https://www.amazon.in/JOLT-Effect-Performers-Overcome-Indecision/dp/0593538102\n\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUzEgRetmC4&t=368s\n\n4. https://www.amazon.com/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation/dp/1591844355\n\nTenali AI\n\nBlog\n\nLess is More: Amalgamating Yusuf Dikec's Winning Formula for B2B Sales with AI\nIntroducing Tenali Enterprise Search: Private & Secure ChatGPT with your data\nHow to Jolt Your Prospects Out of Indecision with Real Examples\n\nLegal\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nZoom SDK Integration\n\n¬© 2024 by Tenali AI, Inc.
